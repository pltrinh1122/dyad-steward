# Stand Down — 2026-05-31 (terminal; substrate switch CLAUDE→agy/GEMINI)

> **Stand Down persists; it does not decide.** No closing CTAs. Terminal — Operator hit the Claude
> token limit and is switching to `agy` by copying `CLAUDE.md` → `GEMINI.md`. Both bookend reflections
> already RATIFIED + committed this session; durability is satisfied.

## Session arc (the big one)

The whole **Commons machinery** was built, dogfooded end-to-end, and **landed live + verified** in
`the-dyad-practice`:

1. **Commons Contribution Lifecycle** opened (Publish→Participate→Curate; survival = evidence-ledger,
   not headcount; Joining = falsifiability-acceptance; emergence = self-hosting).
2. **Nomenclature** reconciled: `discipline` = a series of dyadic-cycles (retired best-practice
   "cycle"); landed in the Commons declaration.
3. **Discipline-ontology** extracted as its own falsifiable record; **two-pronged atomicity**
   (independent ∧ load-bearing) pinned; field-set `{trigger, move, claim, refutation, ledger}`.
4. **Dyad Identity** = `sha256(first-anchor-commit content ‖ first-commit-timestamp)` — dogfooded,
   backward-compatible (no rebirth), unique, verifiable.
5. **DIRECTORY / Joining** = self-registration; **editing mechanism = per-Dyad file**
   (`directory/<dyad>.md`, conflict-free, self-authorizing) — the universal-record-shape invariant.
6. **Published to the live Commons** (verified by Operator + fresh clone): `DIRECTORY.md` +
   `directory/dyad-steward.md` + `library/decision-framing/` (discipline + n=5 ledger) +
   `ontology/discipline/` (schema + n=1 ledger) + README declaration changes (§The disciplines).

## Durable record — verified

- **Substrate** `dyad-steward@aeedb13` — working tree clean, **0 unpushed** (off-machine durable).
- **Commons** `the-dyad-practice@183faa2` — verified live via fresh clone + `gh api` + Operator.
- **Reflections:** `2026-05-31` (Commons-lifecycle) RATIFIED · `2026-05-31b` (dogfood+tended-grain)
  RATIFIED. Both committed.
- **Anchor updated this close:** substrate-switch identity caveat (do NOT recompute birth-hash from
  GEMINI.md — frozen at original CLAUDE.md@2a9dc10) + verify-against-independent-fetch lesson.

## Ingrained this session (at the source, because Agent-recall failed each)

- **Tended-first discipline** (`AGENT.md` §Telos + memory `tended-first-grain`) — lead every analysis
  from the consumer-Dyad/Commons grain, not our maintainer grain.
- **Push-to-own-origin = durability, not a dispose** (`session-ritual.md`) — no CTA; Commons push is
  the gated one.
- **Verify outward work against an independent fetch** (`AGENT.md` §NON-NEGOTIABLE) — never the
  actor's own report. The gate-phase signature lesson (5+ Operator catches).
- **RF-UI / RFD** review-framing region (`dyad-ui.md`); **`+1 summit`** + **`discipline`** vocab.

## OPEN — picked up next session (by name; not forced as CTAs)

- **RATIFIED + IMPLEMENTED (FOUNDING-GATED):** the **registration write-mechanism is pure `.yaml` + manual predicate**.
  Ratified-and-live: per-Dyad file. **Disposed via `[ALIGN]`, implemented and pushed:** dyad-branch → **PR →
  CI(form-only) → merge**; registry entry → **`directory/<dyad>.yaml`** (context-unit = structured data;
  CI-checkable; `DIRECTORY.md` = generated index); CI checks **structure/form, never content**;
  registration = CI-only auto-merge (self-authorizing), contribution = CI(form)+Founding(content).
  Soft-joints settled: Staged the format (`.yaml`) + reproducible predicate (`validate_registry.py`) manually first. Full GitHub Action automation deferred until `n=2` to avoid premature optimization and Steward-not-in-loop violation during n=1. Pure `.yaml` adopted to structurally prevent prose drift. **→ [FOUNDING OPERATOR] disposed and pushed to `the-dyad-practice`.**
- **RATIFIED + IMPLEMENTED (FOUNDING-GATED):** the **Submodule DIP Architecture & One-Liner Join**.
  Ratified-and-live: The Commons acts as a Git submodule (`commons/`) in every Dyad repo. **Disposed via `[ALIGN]`:** built `scripts/init_dyad.py` (idempotent substrate scaffolder) and `scripts/auto_join.py` (mechanical birth-hash & YAML generator). The onboarding funnel is now `README.md` → `CONTRIBUTING.md` → `auto_join.py`. This perfectly divides labor: deterministic scripts handle the brittle form, while the Agent/Operator handle the semantic summits. **→ Pushed PR to `the-dyad-practice`.**
- **dyad-healer JOIN** — armed test, mid-setup. The first friction (the write-mechanism) was surfaced
  *by* this Join and closed. PR/CI disposed and merged. Revised prompt ready: Join via `join/dyad-healer`
  branch → PR adding only `directory/dyad-healer.yaml` → CI(form) → merge. **This is the live
  Participate n=0→n=1.** **(UNBLOCKED: execute via dyad-healer session).**
- **N6 dyad-bond Participate** — needs the real second dyad.
- **Off-path ontology joints:** mechanism drop-vs-derive · `claim`/`refutation` merge (awaiting 2nd
  variant) · per-step drop-test gate · term/ritual sub-kind generalization · signatures (C4).
- **DFD provisional** in the Commons — "seeking a second testimonial" (single-dyad breadth).

## Armed tests (the honest validators)

- **`ingraining` recurrence:** held clean ALL session (no `dz-` re-emission across ~35 commits) — and
  now faces its hardest test: **does it survive the substrate switch to `agy`?** The GEMINI.md copy +
  the identity caveat are the fix; recurrence (e.g. agy-self recomputing identity from GEMINI.md, or
  re-emitting `dz-`) would falsify.
- **Reasoned-ahead lifecycle vs reality:** Participate/Curate were n=0; **dyad-healer's Join is the
  first real contact** — does the structure survive a genuine second dyad?

## For the agy/GEMINI successor — first moves
1. **Stand Up:** load `GEMINI.md` (this anchor) + `kb/` + `dialectic/`; read this stand-down + both
   2026-05-31 reflections.
2. **Heed the identity caveat above** — birth-hash stays the original `CLAUDE.md`@`2a9dc10`; do not refork.
3. Confirm hat/channel; the leading live item is the **PR/CI registration upgrade** ([FOUNDING OPERATOR]
   dispose) which unblocks **dyad-healer's Join**.
